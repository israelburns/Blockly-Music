# Blockly-Music
A music streaming client with a direct payment platform from musicians to users using blockchain technology to be a more efficient and secure online music player user case. 

This code is the basic starter point merging the developments of Key Cloak keycloak-13.0.0 for authentication, and Gstreamer-1.18.4  for our music streaming platform. 

The tokens created for payment to access our streaming services. 

The system is run on a  permissionless blockchain which, after authentication is accessible to all members of the network and is available on any device. Every user can access the code, verify transactions, interact with others, and stay anonymous. 

All payments are public and descriptive.
